		TEST:

		3) Collect data from 3 or more sensors (simulated, emulated or real) and send to the GDA
		4) Use data from at least one sensor to trigger a local (internal) actuation event due to a configured threshold crossing
		5) Implement 1 or more actuators (emulated or real â€“ NO simulation!!!)
		6) Process actuation events received from the GDA to trigger at least 1 actuation event
		7) Run for at least 1 hour without interruption, and collect / send at least 30 system performance samples, 
		30 sensor data samples, and trigger at least 2 actuator events internally.
