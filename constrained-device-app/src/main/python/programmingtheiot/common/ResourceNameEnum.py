class ResourceNameEnum(Enum):
	"""
	Enum declaration for resource and topic names for the CDA and GDA.
	
	So, why don't we just use the string defined in ConfigConst?
	
	Option 1: (chosen - for now), this may not seem 'Pythonic',
	but it's one way to enforce consistency in resource / topic naming.
	It also limits the number of resource and topic names, which can
	quickly grow out of hand if free reign is provided without any
	semi-strict convention. Finally, it permits relatively straight
	forward mapping to other languages that support Enum's
	(such as Java [and the GDA]).
	
	Option 2: Delegate the resource generation to a separate class
	that generates a resource name based on the typed parameters
	passed into a given function. Similar to Option 1, but names
	are dynamically, yet still consistently, generated.
	
	Option 3: Define resource name keys in ConfigConst,
	and define the resource names within the configuration file.
	I may change over to this model, as it allows for easier
	debugging and on-the-fly changes. Similar to option 1, except
	the resource names are easier to change whenever you'd like.
	
	Option 4: Simply rely on the string to be constructed properly
	within each code module that has to publish / subscribe data to,
	or request / response data from, a server-based resource.
	In short, anything goes.
	
	For now, we'll stick with using Enum's. The name is captured within
	ConfigConst, so it's still relatively easy to debug, IMO.
